# Project_1-
First we define the math operations which are addition (A) , subtraction (S) , multiplication (M) and division (D). 
Then we write our if statemnts which allows the user to choose from the four options addition (A) , subtraction (S) , multiplication (M) and division (D). 
Then we request the user to put two numbers they want to calculate. (number 1 and number 2)
After the user chooses what kind of operation they want to do the program will print the calculations. 
If an invaid operation or number is given it will show an error sign.
